# CultivApp – Documentation

## The Problem

Colombian farmers without expensive technology (sensors, weather stations) rely on inherited intuition for crop decisions. Missing optimal timing for irrigation, fertilization, or pest control causes productivity losses.

This **widens the tech gap**, limits competitiveness, and prevents knowledge transfer to new generations.

## The Solution

**CultivApp** provides an **affordable platform** combining:
1. **Real climate data** from SIATA (Valle de Aburrá Early Warning System)
2. **Farmer-registered crop data** (species, planting date, location)

**Smart recommendations:**
- "Don't irrigate today – rain expected"
- "Day 20 since planting corn – fertilize now"
- "High rain probability in 24h – adjust fumigation"

**Target Users:**
- Small/medium farmers without sensors
- Agricultural cooperatives & extension agencies
- Research groups & educators
- New farmers entering agriculture
