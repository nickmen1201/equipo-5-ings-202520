# Components

## What does this folder do?
Reusable React UI components used across pages (cards, forms, navigation, layout).

## How to install this part
No separate installation. Components are part of the app built from `client/src` with `npm install`.

## How to run this part
Use `npm run dev` from `client/src`.

## Standards to consider
- Component props documented via JSDoc when useful.
- Keep components stateless/presentational when possible.
- TailwindCSS utility classes for styling.

## JavaScript version
ES2022+ with JSX (React 18+).

## Database requirements
None. Components do not access the database directly.
