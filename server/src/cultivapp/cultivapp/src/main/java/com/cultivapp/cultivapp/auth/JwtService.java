/**
 * JWT Service - Token Generation and Management (REQ-001: Login Authentication)
 * 
 * This service is responsible for generating JSON Web Tokens (JWT) after successful
 * user authentication. JWTs are used for stateless authentication, allowing the client
 * to prove their identity on subsequent requests without storing session data on the server.
 * 
 * JWT Structure:
 * - Header: Contains the token type (JWT) and signing algorithm (HS256).
 * - Payload: Contains claims (user data) such as email (subject) and role.
 * - Signature: Ensures the token hasn't been tampered with, created using a secret key.
 * 
 * Security Features:
 * - Tokens are signed with HMAC-SHA256 algorithm to prevent tampering.
 * - Tokens have a configurable expiration time to limit their validity.
 * - The secret key is loaded from application.properties for easy configuration.
 * 
 * REQ-001 Usage:
 * - After successful login, AuthService calls generate() to create a JWT.
 * - The JWT contains the user's email (subject) and role (claim).
 * - The client stores this token and sends it with future API requests.

     * @param subject The subject of the token (typically the user's email).
     *                This identifies who the token belongs to.
     * @param claims Additional data to include in the token (e.g., {"role": "ADMIN"}).
     *               These claims can be used for authorization decisions.
     * @return A signed JWT token as a String, ready to be sent to the client.

     * Security Note: The token is signed but not encrypted. Don't include sensitive
     * data in claims as they can be decoded (but not modified without the secret key).
